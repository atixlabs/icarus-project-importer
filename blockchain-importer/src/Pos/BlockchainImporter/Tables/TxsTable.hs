    Given the possible events:
    - Tx gets confirmed (tx becomes Successful)
    - Tx sending fails (tx becomes Failed)
    - Tx gets created (tx becomes Pending)
    The difference between the trTimestamp and trLastUpdate is that:
    - trTimestamp is the time the event happened, that the tx changed it's state
    - trLastUpdate is the time the importer learned of this event

    The main case where both timestamp differ is when syncing from peers, trTimestamp is
    the moment that block was created (no matter how long ago this was) while trLastUpdate
    is the moment the importer received the block.

    Both are needed, as trTimestap is the one the user is interested of knowing, while
    trLastUpdate is used for fetching those events
